cluelessplayer
==============

the purpose of this school project is to create a computer player for a scaled-down version of the game, Clue.

For instantiating and calling the public methods in this sub-system, review the auto.automaton module Player class, 
which includes the three public methods, receive_cards, take_turn and update. 

Documentation will be included with this project as it stabilizes.
